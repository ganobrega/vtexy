# Quick start

The setup of VTEXY is very quick and simple, and can be done in less than 5 minutes. Soon we will have a video tutorial.

### System requirements

First check the technical requirements to continue the setup.

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 8.17.0 or later
- MacOS, Windows or Linux

### Installation

Well, let's start by installing the `vtexy` package globally. This will allow us to use the **CLI** that comes with it.

```
 $ npm i vtexy -g
```

Once installed, go to the directory you use to clone your projects.

Use the following command and interact with the CLI interface.

```
 $ vtexy init
```

> The CLI allows you to create a new folder or install everything in the current folder.

After creating your project, go to its directory and use the following command to start the development.

```
 $ vtexy start
```
